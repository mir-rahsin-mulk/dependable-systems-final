All of the code in this repo should run out of the box in the Ubuntu virtual environment provided for the LLFI tutorial.

## Test the time and errors generated by fi injection

### Bubble Sort
From folder "sample_programs/bubble_Sort" run:
`bash time_execution.sh`
`python3 measure.py`

Open time_execution.sh and add or remove numbers from input array to change input.

### Swaptions
From folder "sample_programs/swaptions" run:
`bash time_execution.sh 500`
`python3 measure.py`

`bash time_execution.sh 449`
`python3 measure.py`

## Test the input sizing algorithm for bubble sort

Open input_minimizer.py in a python3 terminal and run:
`minimizer(p_list_ref=[20, 1], iqt="coverage", min_obj="time", lower=1, c=0.9)`

## Regenerate files

To regenerate the llvm pass and the lli folder follow the tutorials posted earlier in the semester.

The only difference is to generate .ll files for swaptions run:
`clang++ -S -emit-llvm *.c* -fno-use-cxa-atexit`
`llvm-link *.ll -o output_linkeda.ll`

The source code for llvm pass for dynamic counter is in the CallCount folder. But the compiled file is in both sample_program folders.
